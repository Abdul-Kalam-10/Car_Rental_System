# Car_Rental_System
The car rental system implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) revolves around the creation of three key classes: Car, Customer, and RentalSystem. The Car class encapsulates the properties and state of a car, including a unique identifier, model, and availability status. The Customer class represents a customer, storing information such as a unique identifier and name. The heart of the system lies in the RentalSystem class, which manages the interactions between cars and customers.
In this system, cars are added to the fleet with specific identifiers and models, and customers are registered with unique identifiers and names. The rentCar method in the RentalSystem class enables customers to rent available cars. It checks the availability of the specified car and the existence of the customer before facilitating the rental. If the conditions are met, the car's availability is updated, and a message indicating the successful rental is displayed. Otherwise, an appropriate error message is generated.
The implementation showcases fundamental principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Each class encapsulates its attributes and behaviors, promoting modularity and code organization. Additionally, the system demonstrates the use of methods for specific functionalities, contributing to a clear and maintainable code structure. Overall, this car rental system serves as a foundation that can be extended and enhanced to accommodate more sophisticated features in a real-world scenario.
